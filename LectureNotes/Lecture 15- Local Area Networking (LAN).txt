TCP/IP
  -The primary hardware technology used today is a standard called Ethernet
    -It is great for transferring frames from one computer the the next
    -But does not provide resources.
-Local Area Network (LAN)
  -LAN is a network of computers that are physically connected to each other via a switch and are part of the same broadcast domain
-Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
  -Labels each local area network with an address called a Logical Address
  -Routers
    -routers don't care about MAC addresses, just logical addresses
    -They act as an intermediary between networks
      -a computer encapsulates it's 'Packet' (a chunk of information addressed with a logical address) inside of an Ethernet Frame and  sends a frame to the mac address of the router.
      -the router unpacks the frame, and then recreates a new ethernet frame addressed to the correct MAC address
-The numbering system (192.168.1.1)
  -The idea behind it was that we would have routers spaced all over the US.
  -these routers would be interconnected by high speed powerful lines and then each router would connect to smaller local networks
  -Each router has one single number assigned to it between 0 and 255, but not including 0 or 255. Let's say 14 for this example
    -then other routers connect to these routers, as lower points, not on the same "backbone of the internet"
    -these routers would then get a number assigned to is. let's say 11 for our example. The full address of this router would be 14.11
  -But then each of these routers are connected to by even smaller networks, which each get a number assigned, we'll say 27. That would make it 14.11.27
  -It then finally reaches the user's home router. Which we'll say has the number 19 assigned to it. 14.11.27.19
  -And poof, you have your TCP/IP address.

Network ID's and Subnet Mask
  -Open command prompt and use the command IPCONFIG
  -This opens up the windows IP configuration which displays your 
    -IPv4 address
    -the subnet mask address
      -within a network ID, all computers have the same subnet mask
    -and the default gateway
      -Logical address of your router
  -Network ID (192.168.1)
    -This is the address your switch uses for each of your computers/devices on the network
    -the fourth value is then assigned to each connected device giving the full network ID (192.168.1.25)
    -This identifies your device on the network
  -Subnet Mask
    -the subnet mask is the address value that is sent to the switch from a computer with an IP address.
    -the computer then checks to see if the values of the destination IP address match it's own.
    -the 255 means that the values must match the Network ID
    -the 0 means that the IP address can have a different value than the network ID.
    -If the three are 255.255.255.0
      -The switch can see that the destination IP address is on the same network, check the IP address and send the packet the appropriate computer
    -If the destination IP address is outside of the switch's network, the subnet mask will be 0.0.0.0
      -this indicates that the destination is not on the local network, so the switch passes the packet to the router to be sent off
    -This let's the switch determine between a local call and a long distance call

-Network Admin
  -To set up your network addresses, you'll use software.
  -Open windows > control panel > network and sharing center
    -Change Adapter Settings
    -Right click ethernet
    -click properties
    -go to IPv4
    -select properties
      -Set a static IP address
        -provide IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway
    -Usually your router is set to 192.168.1.1

-Dynamic IP Addressing
  -DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
    -Most computers today do not need to have their IP address set up statically
      -DHCP handles this for you
    -This is built into your switch and will assign a computer an open Network ID, and also pass the Subnet Mask and Default Gateway
  -How to set up DHCP
    -Go into IPv4 properties
    -By default, it is set to use DHCP
  -When DHCP Fails
    -If the DHCP server goes down for one reason or another, your IP address may be gone
      -169.254.x.x
        -If you see this, it is an APIPA Address. (Automatic Private Internet Protocol Addressing)
          -If your computer cannot get to the DHCP servers, windows will default to an APIPA address
          -if you see an address that starts with 169.254 it is an APIPA. This will be on the exam
    -So you need to re-establish the connection
      -ipconfig /renew
        -this will reset your IP address
      -ipconfig /release
        -this will release your IP address
   -Apipa addressing can be odd
     -if the dhcp server goes down, everyone stays connected, but loses their IP addresses. 
     -they are all then assigned an APIPA address beginning with 169.254 and the last two digits aare assigned randomly
     -If everyone can get still see each other, but not get on the internet, its usually a DHCP  issue
     -you must be connected to the network to have an APIPA address, otherwise your computer will completely lose it's IP address
   -know your network ID
     -Rogue DHCP server
       -this hands out an unauthorized ip address
         -for example, if your Network ID is 192.168.1.25 and suddenly it's showing as 192.168.5.93 then you may have a rogue HDCP
       -this can happen if someone plugs in a differernt router into the network. 
    
APIPA
  -go to control panel
  -go to network settings > change adpter settings > ethernet properties > IPv4 > alternate configuration tab
  -Failover options are to use an APIPA or a Static IP address that you can set here

NAT
  -Once the internet began to run out of IP addresses
  -to get around this, they came up with Network Address Translation (NAT)
    -This allows a router to share one IP address across many computers
  -a router capable of nat will look into a packet being sent from a local computer
    -it will then look at the IP address of the sender and will grab some unique info
       -it then writes this into a NAT table
       -it then rewrites the the individual computer address with the public IP address
       -when the packet comes back in to the router, it then compares the return public address with it's table to find the network address of the computer

Special IP Addresses
  -Broadcast
    -255.255.255.255
      -every computer on the local area network will take in that backet
  -loopback
    -you can ping another computer by using ping followed by the address of that computer
    -to ping yourself, the address is 127.0.0.1
      -this is used to test you own connection to the server
      -you can ping localhost as well, it's the same thing
  -APIPA addresses
     -These all start with 169.254
  -Private IP addresses
    -These addresses are not used on the internet, only inside a local network
      -three sets
        -any ip address that starts with a 10
        -any ap address between the range of 172.16 through 172.31
        -the other is any address that start with 192.168 
          -you set the third value
          -most famous type of IP addresses

Ping and IPConfig
  -Ping allows you to contact another computer on your network to ensure a connection
    -How-to
      -Open command prompt
      -type ping 192.168.1.whatever the target is
      -hit enter
    -Ping will then give you 4 responses
    -Continous Ping
      -ping -t 192.168.1. whatever
      -to stop hit ctrl+c
    -Name Translation
      -add the -a flag to force IP to name translation
    -ping is mostly used for local networks, and runs into a lot of issues when attempting to ping outside your local network as most routers have firewalling to prevent ping response
    
  -IPconfig
    -open command prompt and enter ipconfig to check your own ip address
    -ipconfig /all
      -this gives the full information
    -ipconfig /


TCP, UDP, and ICMP
  -In a TCP/IP address, the TCP(transmission control protocol) is the protocol for how to talk to another computer, the IP is just your address
     -TCP
       -All web browsers use TCP
       -It's connection oriented
         -this means that when two devices decide to talk to each other, TCP negotiates to create a connection between client and server 
  -There other protocals than TCP are
    -UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
      -connectionless
        -data is sent regardless of connection status
      -much less overhead than TCP, thus fafster
      -used by DHCP servers
    -ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol)
      -The maintenance protocol for an ip network
      -is used by ping
      -connectionless
      -sends 1 packet only

Port Numbers
  -A value between 0-65535 thats part of every TCP or UDP packet
  -Each packet actually has 2 port numbers
    -the first is used by the receiving system to dertermine the program that needs this data
    -(ethereal port number) the second number is like a return address the system uses to respond
  -The first 1024 ports are known as 'well known ports'
  -Web servers are designed to listen on port 80
  -Here are the ones I need to memorize
    21 FTP
    22 SSH
    23 TELNET
    25 SMTP
    53 DNS
    80 HTTP
    110 POP
    143 IMAP
    443 HTTPS
    3389 RDP
    137-139 NETBIOS/NETBT
    445 SMP/CIFS
    427 SLP
    548 AFP

Working with connections
  -You need to be able to see what your computer is connected to. Here's how!
    -Netstat
      -very old, but powerful command line tool
      -open command line and enter the command netstat
      -this will then display all of the connections
      -if you add the -n flag, it will change the ouptput to numerical
      -if you add the -a flag it will show all network connections
    -TCPView
      -This is a free third party program that shows network connection information in graphical format
      -this is shown in real time, unlike netstat which has to be rerun to update
    
DNS
  -Domain Name System
  -basically an address book for ip addresses hosted by millions of DNS servers
  -Fully Qualified Domain Name
    -cannot have more than 256 characters
    -www.totalsem.com
    -Top Level Domain
      -.com
      -.edu
      -.gov     
    -Individual Host Name
      -can be anything, but we follow certain etiquettes
      -Web Server
         -www.
      -File transfer protocol
         -ftp.
      -Mail Server
        -mail.
    -Secondary Domain Name
      -All kinds of flexibility here
      -this is the name of the site
 -DNS Servers
   -They respond to DNS queries and respond to DNS queries
   -if you type ipconfig /all you'll see your DNS settings
   -When you type in www.google.com your computer sends a query to the local DNS server and asks for the ip address of www.google.com
   -If the DNS server has the ip address it will give it to you, but if not, it will go to a root server and ask for the ip address
   -the root server will then direct the DNS server to the ip address of the nearest top level domain server
   -the DNS server will then query the top level domain server to find the ip address of www.google.com
   -the top level domain server will then give the DNS the ip address of google.com 
   -the DNS server will then query the web server for google.com for the ip address associated with www. 
   -then the web server will respond to the DNS server with the full ip address which will be returned to your computer
   -your web browser then connects to that ip address

   
Dealing with DNS
  -How to configure DNS
    -go to network connections
    -right click and go to properties
    -go to ipv4 properties
  -How to find your DNS server
    -ipconfig /all
  -What to do when DNS goes down 
    -use the command prompt ping www.google.com
      -if it responds with a ip address, the DNS server is not down
      -if it doesnt respond with an ip address, DNS is down
  -nslookup
    -command line utlity designed to talk to DNS servers and query it
    -DNS servers no longer listen to NS look up for the most part
    -it will show you the DNS server and it's ip address
    -you can also query a DNS server to see if it's up and running
  -Call your ISP

Windows Naming
  -Work group vs domain
    -when you install windows you do two things
      -give it a name
      -give it the type of network its in either a work group or a domain
    -work group
      -all computers are peers
      -all computers are connected to same switch
      -these computers broadcast their names across the network to other computers
      -to configure
        -go to control panel > systems
        -advanced system settings
        -go to computer name tab
          -set up pc name
    -domain
      -a seperate computer running a software called Windows Server
      -this system acts as a domain controller
      -use remote desktop to talk to the server
        -home editions of windows cannot join domains
        -has built in DNS server
        -has built in DHCP Server
        -Server manager
          -program to establish a domain 
      -to connect a computer to the domain
        -open the advanced system settings and go to the computer name tab
        -click on domain
      -you have to have an account on the domain to join the domain

NET Command
  -command line tool 
  - predates windws
  -net view
    -this shows the devices connected to the netwrk

        -this shows the computers attached to the server
      -open command prompt (admin)
        -use netdom command
        -netdom add computerName
  -to remove
    -netdom remove 

Windows Name Resolution
  -Before Vista
    -If a computer has been connected to a Domain, it will reach out to the domain controller and everything is handled by the controller's built in DNS system
    -if it wasn't on a domain, you could adjust it using your NETBIOS ports
  -After windows Vista
      -Link Local Multi-Cast Name Resolution (LLMNR)
        -UDP port 5355
        -in windows pro, it uses netbios and llmnr
        -in windows home, it uses just llmnr
      -NBT Stat
        -doesn't work well with llmnr
        -there are a few issues with it, but it can be used to help with troubleshooting
        -command line tool
        -if entered by itself, you'll get a help screen, but several commands dont work anymore
          -the ones we will use
             -n (minus n flag) 
               -shows the current computers registered name
             -c (minus c flag)
               -shows the NBT Cache
               -these caches reset after a minute or two
               -you can use netview to refresh this cache
             -a (minus a flag)
               -used to go talk with another computer on the network
               -you'll use nbtstat -a systemname
               -this will show you the -n registered name information for the target computer
             -r (minus r flag)
               -shows statistics
               -this is an obsolete function, as it does not function with llmnr
             -take all registered information and rebroadcast it
             -or reset the cash with 
               -nbtstat -R
                 -That clears remote cache table
               -nbtstat -RR
                 -rebroadcasts your information

Routers
  -interconnect broadcast domains
  -Wide area network
    -open to internet
  -Local area network
    -offline network
  -routers dont care where packets come from, only where they go to
  -routers utilzie a routing table
    -this is a table utilizing IP, subnetmask and interface
    -this is what the router uses to send information out
    -there is a default route to send anything out, unless, it is addressed to one of the LAN networks
    -routers eliminate all broadcast messages when they recieve them, which they do, since they are on the LAN network
    
Configuring Routers
  -SOHO Routers (Small Office/Home Office)
    -can support only tens of users
    -usually also a switch and wireless
    -one connector will be a different color, this is the cable that connects to the ISP (usually via modem)
    -connect to the router with a computer via ethernet cable to configure.
    -when initially configuring a router, do not connect to WAN yet.
    -find the default IP address in the manufacturers book, or even better is to use ipconfig
      -your default gateway is the router
    -navigate to the default IP
    -Find the default username and password for the router in the manual or online
    -login to the router interface.
    -First thing's first, change that password!
      -make sure to change the login to the router password.
      -Ensure you click apply!
    -Once the password has changed, you'll have to log in again
    -LAN Setup
      -Next, change the network ID
      -Change the default IP address to a different private IP address
        -keep the .1 for the router
        -WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN!!!!
        -Did you click apply?
      -You'll have to go to the new IP to continue configuration
      -Set up DHCP
        -usually under LAN 
        -Consider how many computers can be on your network at any one time
          -limit the IP pool to that many systems
      -Set up DNS
        -nothing you really need to do, once connected to ISP, it will be auto-configured
        -If you do need to connect to a particular DNS server, you can input a default one
    -WAN Setup
      -WAN Connection Type
        -Automatic IP
          -your router is a dhcp client, and asks for an IP address from your ISP
        -Static IP
          -pay extra for this
          -usually done where you have servers running
          -IP address will be given by your ISP
        -PPPoe
          -toolset to allow ISPs to make you log-in before access to internet
      -Firewalls
        -Ensure the firewall is turned on before connecting to WAN
      

Advanced Router Configuration
  -Port Forwarding
    -SOHO routers block incoming requests
    -Incoming requests on port 80 go to the camera
      -Go to router settings port forwarding
      -Enter a name for the device
      -enter the port range (80)
      -enter the device's ip address
      -Set local port to 80
      -TCP protocol selected
      -add it
    -one issue we run into is the commonality of port 80
      -set the port range to 8181 and the local range to 80
      -this makes it so that you have to type in the ip address with a colon and 8181 after it. So it'd be 192.168.4.62:8181
    -DMZ (demilitarized zone)
      -anything comes in on port 80
      -this is terrible
    -
  -Port Triggering
    -this is when you are trying to do FTP, your computer sends request to FTP server on port 21, and FTP server responds on Port 20
    -your router will block this return as it has had no outbound connection on port 20
    -Port triggering will allow access to port 20 while communications are being held on port 21
    -Set up
      -go to router settings
      -find port triggering
        -give it a name, a trigger port (21), TCP protocol, and an incoming port (20)
        -click apply
  -Quality of Service
    -This is telling the router how to prioritize bandwith amongst ports
    -input your upload and download speed, which is provided by your ISP
    -the old fashioned way to set it up
      -User Defined quality of service rules
        -select a service
          -you can also input a destination port
          -source IP is for if you want to throttle a particular device
          -set priority
      -User defined priorities 
        -this will show you the priorities and values associated with them
