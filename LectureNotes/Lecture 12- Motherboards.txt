Form Factors-
-What are Form Factors?
 -Standardized set of forms that define the sizes of different PC components, such as size, shape, and connections
 
 -IBM AT Form Factor
  -IBM built this computer with standardized holes to make everything easier
  -This was a famous form Factor
  -Allowed everyone to use the same sizes that they had set, and suddenly, we had the IBM-standardized form Factor
  -For almost the first 10 years of the computer world, the AT form factor was dominent
  -didnt ventilate well, didnt specify where to place the CPU, and no low-profile computer processing.

-Riser Card
 -in an attempt to supplant AT Form Factor, everyone was trying to get lower profiles to shrink overall computer size
 -an L-shaped port to plug in cards sideways while trying to keep a low profile while still supporting full sized cards.

-ATX Form Factor
 -Developed by Intel in the late 1990s
 -Replaced the AT form factor, and that's the world we live in today.


ATX and ITX Motherboards
-What kept ATX around so long?
  -it was free, Intel pushed it as standardized
  -manufacturers backed it, and so there hasnt been a shift in a while
-Full Size ATX Motherboard-
  12x9.6 inches
  AT form factor only had little holes for individual items
  brought about the I/O Area (Input/Output Area) faceplate with a set size
-ATX also set the standard size for Power Supply

4 Types of ATX cards
-Standard ATX
    
-Micro ATX

-Micro ATX

-Flex ATX
 -Is a 'Small Form Factor'
 -brought about the ideas for small systems mostly used for single purpose items (Point of Sale Terminals, Home theater systems, etc.)
 -

ITX
 -There is no standard for ITX
