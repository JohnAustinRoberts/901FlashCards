Form Factors-
-What are Form Factors?
 -Standardized set of forms that define the sizes of different PC components, such as size, shape, and connections
 
 -IBM AT Form Factor
  -IBM built this computer with standardized holes to make everything easier
  -This was a famous form Factor
  -Allowed everyone to use the same sizes that they had set, and suddenly, we had the IBM-standardized form Factor
  -For almost the first 10 years of the computer world, the AT form factor was dominent
  -didnt ventilate well, didnt specify where to place the CPU, and no low-profile computer processing.

-Riser Card
 -in an attempt to supplant AT Form Factor, everyone was trying to get lower profiles to shrink overall computer size
 -an L-shaped port to plug in cards sideways while trying to keep a low profile while still supporting full sized cards.

-ATX Form Factor
 -Developed by Intel in the late 1990s
 -Replaced the AT form factor, and that's the world we live in today.
