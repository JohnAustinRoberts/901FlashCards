Printers! 
  4 Types to know
    -Dot Matrix
      -Impact Printer (Can do carbon copys)
    -Inkjet
      -great way to make multiple colors
    -Thermal Printers
      -cheap
      -not good for permenant storage
    -Laser Printers
      -uses photossensitive drum
        -designed to hold a charge (usuallly negative) depending on where light hits it, it'll have less charge  
      -7 Step Printing Process
        -Step 1 - Processing 
          -uses RAM to store the data 
        -Step 2 - Charge Roll lays negative charge onto photosensitive drum
        -Step 3 - Exposing 
          -a laser is run back and forth and hits where the image will be 
          -difference of about 300 volts
        -Step 4 - developing
          -bring the toner close to the area with the negative charge between the charge given by the initial step and the laser's charge
          -this brings the toner into where the laser hit
        -Step 5 - transferring
          -uses transfer roller to put extremely positive charge on the paper
          -this causes the toner to jump to the page
        -Step 6 - Fusing
          -uses heat to dry the toner
        -Step 7 - Cleaning
          -scrapers run across the drum and scrape off leftover toner
  -The Thermal, Inkjet, and Dot Matrix technologies are all similar in that it all boils down to a series of tubes
    -Dot Matrix printer uses pins that poke through a colored ribbon to print
    -replace the pins with heating wires and its thermal printer
    -inkjet no pins or wires, its literally tubes connected to resevoirs and shoots the bubbles of ink onto the paper


Printer Connections
  -To connect a printer to a network there are two options
    -connect a printer to a computer and allow that computer to share the printer on the network
      -Parallel and Centronics
        -Centronics
          -D-shaped 30 pin connector
        -Parallel
          -25 pin D-shaped connector    
      -USB-B Connector
        -try to use this option
    -connect the printer to the network and share it from there
      -ethernet connection
        -can set the printer with an IP address and it can be connected
      -print server
        -connected by ethernet cable it can get an ip address
          -(some can be configured wirelessly)
        -then connect to a printer without network capabilities via a usb connection
      -wireless connection
        -some printers have wireless capability built in
      
Maintaining Impact Printers (Dot Matrix)
  -Dot Matrix is an old technology that requires a lot of maintenance
  -Designed to handle tractor feed paper - that paper with the holes on the side
  -Parts of the Dot Matrix Printer  
    -print head
      -has the pins inside it
      -Inside of print head can get dirty, if you get speckled print, you may need to clean the print head
        -you can clean it with isopropyl alcohol
    -ink ribbon
      -sits around the print head
      -there is a rewind tab to rewind the ribbon when it gets low, so that you may be able to get another use out of it.
    -platen
      -the roller that is the back side of the paper
      -it must be squared with the print head, there are adjusting screws to manipulate it, but adjusting it is a type of art form
  -Never use an air gun to clean a printer(you can outside, but it'll blast ink everywhere), use an anti-static vacuum

Maintaining Inkjet Printers 
  -the first and most important step, you'll hear the carriage bring the ink cartridges over to a maintenance area and caps the inkjet tubes
  -most maintenance is actually done via software
    -check if your printer came with a program
      -Align Printheads
        -over time, jets will lose alignment, making blurry prints
        -run this program and you should be good
      -Clean Printheads
        -If you arent getting any of one color, use this program
        -this will run an agressive program to clean the printhead and clear any blockage. This will usually work
      -Printhead Health
        -unique to HP
      -Estimated Ink Levels 
        -Graphical display of how much ink is remaining
  -keep printing (at least once a week) to reduce risk of clogs
  -some print heads are replaceable, others are not
  -Don't use an airgun for cleaning
  -If you are getting any other issues, ensure that there is no electromagnetic interference

Maintaining Laser Printers
  -Can last for a long time with proper maintenance
  -Maintenance Kit
    -passed out by the manufacturer to keep your system up and running
    -make sure to get with your manufacturer to get these!
  -Issues you may see
    -Toner Cartridge
      -if it prints lightly, shake it a little bit
      -if you have any kind of mark on the photosensitive drum it will show on every print
    -Generate a lot of o-zone
      -all lasers come with o-zone filters
      -if you are getting a lot of jams and the takeup rollers are hard as a rock
        -your filter is dead, check with maunfacturer for replacement
    -What would happen if any of the 7 steps of laser printing failed
      -Step 1 - Processing 
        -If you get a string of ascii characters, check your drivers
      -Step 2 - Primary Charge
        -if there is no charge to the photosensitive drum, you'll come out with images from the last print job with the new print
      -Step 3 - Laser 
        -blank sheets of paper if there's no laser operation
      -Step 4 - Toner
        -Toner will fade over time, so watch for that
        -if it fails to get a charge, it will jump to the entire page and print a black sheet
      -Step 5 - Transfer
        -if no charge is given to the paper, you'll have no toner jump to it, and thus, a blank page
      -Step 6 - Fusion
        -If the image is coming out smeared, the fusion process is not happening correctly
      -Step 7 - Static Eliminator
        -If the paper comes out staticky, the eliminator is not working
    -Other Issues
      -RAM Constraints
        -If you try to print something bigger than the RAM of the printer, you'll get an error
      -check your DPI (Dots Per Inch)
        -don't run it higher than needed
      -Paper
        -Paper is friggin expensive
          -But cheap paper can cause huge problems
      
Troubleshoot Print Jobs
  -Issues that you may see
    -If your printer isn't working
      -Check printer properties
        -make sure you're printing to the correct one
          -check your default print settings
        -Print Spooler
          -List of print jobs
          -If a print spool is full, but the printer is offline, as soon as the printer comes online, the jobs will be sent
          -If you can't cancel a job, check your permissions in printer properties (under security)
      -No connectivity
        -When never connected before
          -check your connections
          -check your network configuration
            -is DHCP running?
            -is the printer connected to the switch?
            -are you querying it via DNS name but DNS is down?
        -when can't connect to your normal printer
          -check your connections
      -Print Management (Windows 7 Only)
        -gives you an idea of what is on your system
          -lists printers, drivers, print servers
