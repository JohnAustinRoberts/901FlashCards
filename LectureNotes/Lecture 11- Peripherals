CD Media-
  -CD Optical Media
    -back in 1970s CDs were created as a replacement to vinyl record
    -CDDA (Compact Disc Digital Audio)
        -Stored everything in lands and pits on the back of the CD
        -Speeds
          -The first CDs started at a rated speed, newer cd's read at a multiplier (52x can read at up to 52 times faster than the original speed)
          -A CD-R will have 2 speeds listed, one for reading, one for writing
          -A CD-RW will have a read speed, a write speed, and a re-write speed.
        -Designed to store music, so measured in time 
          -Longest album length was about 74 minutes (the longest version of Beethoven's 9th they could find.)
        -Most of the data is more towards the label side
        -The issue this caused when looking to instead transfer data was the way the CD stored information
          -It was stored in a spiral, and was broken into 'tracks' similar to how a songs would be on a vinyl record
        -Organization called ISO (European Industry Standards Organization) came up with ISO 9660
          -This took the CDDA format and created a format for storage for files and storage
          -You would have to reformat the CDDA to a CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read Only Memory)
          -Used as a distribution media primarily in the early days of CD-ROM
          -They then realized they could get extra space in the center
            -The first generation of CD-ROM stored about 650mb of data (74 minutes)
            -once they added to that space, they were able to increase that size to 700mb (80 minutes)
          -Downside is Read only, so You could only read from the disc, not write to it (i.e. saving anything)
        -CD-R is born
          -CD-R (compact Disc Recordable)
          -These are burn once type of optical media
          -same size as CD-ROMs but able to be written to once
          -A CD-R optical drive would have 2 lasers, one for reading, one for writing. 
        -CD-RW (Compact Disc ReWritable)
          -These can be read, burned, erased, and burned again 
        
DVD Media-
  -DVD originally stood for Digital Video Disc, but now stands for Digital Versital Disc
  -This was an optical media with the same size as a CD, but designed to store Video
  -From day 1, capacity was determined in gigabytes
    -Single sided
      -Carries data on only one side
      -Average Capacity: 4.7GB
    -Dual sided
      -Carries data on both sides of the disc
      -Average capacity: 9.4GB
    -single layer
      -Only has one layer of data
    -dual layer 
      -each layer is seperated by a half mirror, and must be read by an optical drive with two lasers, on to see on each side of the mirror
      -doubles potential storage
    -All these options created a need for a coding system to show what type of drive each disc was compatible with.
      -DVD 9 
        -Single sided dual layer
      -

      -
  -DVDs easily can hold and transfer data
    -this is what the computer calls a Compact Disc File System (CDFS)
    -can use a program called El Torrito to create a boot drive on a DVD or CD
      -can then boot off either DVD or CD (these are called Live CDs)
    -The actual disc is called DVD-ROM
    -DVD+R
      -Write once, read as many times as you want
      -the + caused an issue, with compatibilty issues as there were also DVD-R.
      -Has the same capacity as DVD
    -DVD+RW
      -Had worse incompatiblity issues than DVD+Rs, but thats mostly sorted out these days
      -Could read, write, erase, and write again
    -DVD-RAM
      -it comes in a cartridge
      -you needed to have a specific drive to read the cartridges
  -Region Codes
    -Since DVDs were designed with movie distribution in mind, DVDs that have movies have region codes built into them
    -DVDs sold in different Countries have different Region codes. (I.e. USA is Region Code #1)
    -DVD players also have region codes, in an attempt to dissuade people from buying DVDs from overseas
  -DVDs come in speeds
    -DVD player will have one speed
    -DVD-R will have read and write speed
    -DVD-RW will have read write and rewrite speeds 

Blu-ray Media
  -Allowed more storage and therefore much higher video resolution.
  -Most common sizes are 25gb or 50gb (Single sided single layer or single sided dual layer)
  -Blu-ray follows region codes 
  -Requires High Bandwith Digital Content Protection (HDCP)
    -This means that to play a blu-ray at full resolution, you'll need HDCP compliant equipment
  -Blu-ray Recordable (BD-R)
    -It is required to use UDF format to write to blu-ray
      -this writes in a more concise fashion
  -Blue-Ray Recordable/Erasable (BD-RE)
    -Basically blu-ray read write

Universal Serial Bus-
  -USB! USB! USB!
  -Everything uses USB!
  -Been around over 15 years
  -Types of USB
    -USB 1.0 1.5MBPS - (for keyboards and mice)
             12MBPs - (for everything else)
    -USB 2.0 480 MBPS
    -USB 3.0 5GBPS
  -USB-A
    -The USB is permenantly attached to a peripheral at one end, with an open dongle at the other
    -Points towards the PC
    -downstream connector
  -USB-B
    -This connects to the device
    -Points away from the PC
    -upstream connector
    -Multiple different types, all run at same speeds (except 3.0)
      -USB-B Full size Connector

        -The original USB-B connector
      -USB-B Mini Connector
        -PS3 Charger
      -USB-B Micro Connector
        -PS4 Charger
      -USB 3.0 B Connector 
        -This it the funky wavy connector on your external hard drive
  -USB HUB
    -External USB hubs can be used to connect additional devices, up to 127 devices on one hub!
    -Try to buy a powered hub, since USB devices drain power to function

Firewire and other Connections
  -Occasionally we'll see older connectors
  -Firewire 
    -came around in early 2000s
    -still seen in some video cameras
    -Firewire acts a lot like USB
    -2 Speeds
      -400 megabits/s
        -Known as Firewire 400 
      -800 megabits/s
        -Known as Firewire 800
    -6 connector firewire 400
      -most common firewire
    -4 connector 
      -smaller firewire port
      -worked primarily with video cameras
    -Standard cable length of 4.5 meters
   -Serial ports
      -The oldest connection in PCs
      -Serial connection
        -has 9 pins
        -Is d shaped
        -is called a DB-9 connection
      -Most Cisco routers used what is called a Yost or Rollover Cable
        -This has an RJ45 connector on one end and a Serial connector on the other 
      -Unlike USB or Firewire, you have to assign a value to your serial port, known as your Comport. 
        -You must have your comport number to talk through the serail port.
      -To check if connection worked
        -Open device manager
        -Open ports (COM & LPT)
        -See if you see a Port
        -Fire up PuTTY
        -Click Serial
        -Click Open
        -Hope for success message
    -Parallel Ports
      -Parallel ports are just as old as serial ports
      -DB-25 connector (the 25 pin d shaped connector)
      -Centronics Connector
        -Big connetor with what looks like an hdmi pin array inside the large parallel port shaped connector
        -Pretty much only used for printers
      -If you see a parallel port, the equipment is very old, and should probably be upgraded.
