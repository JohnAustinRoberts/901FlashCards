Motherboards-

Form Factors-
-What are Form Factors?
 -Standardized set of forms that define the sizes of different PC components, such as size, shape, and connections
 
 -IBM AT Form Factor
  -IBM built this computer with standardized holes to make everything easier
  -This was a famous form Factor
  -Allowed everyone to use the same sizes that they had set, and suddenly, we had the IBM-standardized form Factor
  -For almost the first 10 years of the computer world, the AT form factor was dominent
  -didnt ventilate well, didnt specify where to place the CPU, and no low-profile computer processing.

-Riser Card
 -in an attempt to supplant AT Form Factor, everyone was trying to get lower profiles to shrink overall computer size
 -an L-shaped port to plug in cards sideways while trying to keep a low profile while still supporting full sized cards.

-ATX Form Factor
 -Developed by Intel in the late 1990s
 -Replaced the AT form factor, and that's the world we live in today.


ATX and ITX Motherboards
-What kept ATX around so long?
  -it was free, Intel pushed it as standardized
  -manufacturers backed it, and so there hasnt been a shift in a while
-Full Size ATX Motherboard-
  12x9.6 inches
  AT form factor only had little holes for individual items
  brought about the I/O Area (Input/Output Area) faceplate with a set size
-ATX also set the standard size for Power Supply

4 Types of ATX cards
-Standard ATX
    
-Micro ATX

-Micro ATX

-Flex ATX
 -Is a 'Small Form Factor'
 -brought about the idea for small systems mostly used for single purpose items (Point of Sale Terminals, Home theater systems, etc.)
 -

ITX
 -There is no standard for ITX
 -ITX systems are designed for low power systems
 -ITX systems require a smaller power supply, known as a flex-atx or itx power supply
 -Three types to know
  -Mini-ITX
    -170x170mm
    -similar to ATX, uses I/O area, just not the same size as ATX
  -Nano-ITX
  -Pico-ITX
    -incredibly small

What the fuck is a chipset? Are we playing poker or something? Nah, but hopefully that caught you off guard!

Chipsets-
  -Before there were Chipsets
   -Old motherboards were covered in chips. Each one were a single function chip, which made motherboards incredibly expensive.
   -Over time, we began to get VLSA (Very Large Scale Integration Technologies) which consolidated these tasks.
   -Remember the candy.
  -Intel 440BX Chipsets
    -a motherboard that integrated a lot of the functions from discreet chips to a two chip group, defining the term chipset
  Memory Controller-
    -Manages transfer of data between RAM and CPU
    -Northbridge - generally, whoever is handling the memory controlling is the northbridge
      -old pci expansion slots
      -higher speed inputs
    -Southbride - usually deals with slower stuff, (basic I/O, etc)
        -keyboard
        -mouse
  These chips are intended to work together, and with a specific type a CPUs. 

  Typically, as newer technologies were brought in, they were added to the northbridge, pushing older things to the southbridge
Super I/O chip handles legacy connections

on most modern cpus, memory controller is added into the CPU, ridding the need for a dual chip set. Instead we tend to see a single chip scenario with a support chip for legacy items, raid controllers, and other weird things.

The chipset is what truly defines the value of a motherboard.

The Expansion Bus-
  Expansion slots to plug in things like graphics cards, hard drive controllers, etc.
  Only need to know about a few for the A+
    -PCI- Peripheral Connection Interface
      -Came out in mid-90's, designed by Intel
      -32 bit connection running at 33 or 66 mhz
      -king of the expansion bus world for nearly a decade
    -PCI-X
      -PCI on steroids
      -64 bit connection running at 133 mhz
    -Mini-PCI
      -32 bit connection at 33mhz
      -very distinct 100 pin connector
    -PCI-E
      -Uses Serial Communication
      -Runs at 2 gigabits per second or 4 gigabits per second
      -By One/One Lane PCIE
        -Little short connector
        -each lane is a line of communication
      -If you need to transmit more data, add more lanes
      -By 16/16 Lane
        -much longer port, usually with a clip
      -If you want to determine the speed of PCI-E, take the speed of the lane times the number of lanes
    -Mini-PCI-Express
      -52 Pin connector that supports up to two lanes
      -very common in laptops
Parallel vs Serial Communication
 -Parallel communication transmits a signal across multiple wires which then must be delivered, and can cause latency
 -Serial communicaion uses one wire, at a very high speed, reducing latency  


Touring the Motherboard-
    -Make sure your motherboard comes with a book or the disc with drivers
    -you'll also have several extra cables
    -and most importantly, the I/O Shield, which is unique to each model of motherboard

  -Voltage Regulator Modules (VRM)
   -regulates votage across the systems
   -generates a lot of heat
   -connected to chipset via heat-pipe
  -CMOS Clear
    -labeled CLRTC
  -You can find the map of the chips on the motherboard schematic, usuallly towards the front of the motherboard manual

Installing a Motherboard-
  -Read the manual
  -ensure you have the driver disk
  -
  -BEFORE installing into the case-
    -Put on an ESD
    -Install CPU, CPU Fan, RAM, Video Card
    -Connect the motherboard to a monitor and power supply and test the system to ensure it is working.
      -it's easier to fix a poorly mounted CPU fan, or trouble shoot any other issues before the board is in the case
  -Install I/O area to Case by pressing from the inside
  -install motherboard into case, lining up the I/O area and lining up the screw holes in the motherboard with the stand-outs
    -If a motherboard comes with electric resistant washers, install them between the screw and motherboard. 
  -connect front panel switches (power on/ reset/ power light, etc) to motherboard
  -connect front panel connections (audio/usb/mic/etc)
  -the lights for power and Hard drive activity must be plugged in the proper way or nothing will display
  -fire that shit up!
    -we haven't installed hard drives or anything else, so we'll proc an error, but seeing the error means victory!
