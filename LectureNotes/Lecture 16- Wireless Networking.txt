Wireless Networking Hardware
  -80211 Standard
    -Wireless Network Card
      -Also called Wireless NIC
      -contained within the device wishing to connect wirelessly
    -Wireless Access Point
      -Only has 1 ethernet connection in the back
      -This acts as a bridge between a wireless device and a router
    -To set up a wireless network, we ahve 2 options
      -Ad Hoc Mode
        -doesn't use wireless access point
        -one client will create a wireless network, and others will join it
      -Infrastructure Mode
        -you configure a wireless access point, and then connect individual clients
    -Uses Radio Frequencies
      -Uses ISM (Industrail, Scientific, and Medical Bands)
      -Uses 2.4ghz band and 5 ghzband
      -a band is a range of frequencies
      -these bands are broken up into channels
        -these channels help isolate your connection from others running on similar frequencies

WI-FI Standards 
-Memorize Band and Speed for each standard!
  -80211 came out in 1997
  -802.11B
    -Arguably the first big 802.11 standard
    -ran at 2.4ghz
    -11 mb/s
    -two antennae (one for sending, one for receiving)
  -802.11A
    -Came out at about the same time as 802.11B 
    -ran at 5ghz
    -54 mb/s
    -had a few issues on release, so it wasn't as popular
    -also had a smaller range
    -two antennae (one for sending, one for receiving)
  -802.11G
    -A marrying of the speed of 802.11A and the reliability of 802.11B
    -runs at 2.4ghz
    -runs at 54 mb/s
    -backwards compatible with 802.11B
    -not compatible with 802.11A
    -two antennae (one for sending, one for receiving)
  -802.11N
    -brought in a new level of complexity
    -Could run at 2.4 or 5 ghz bands
    -ran at 600mb/s
    -MIMO (Multiple input/Multiple output)
      -could send up to 4 streams of data
    -the downside is that it works in the 2.4 ghz band
    -5ghz is the default, 2.4 was only used for backwards compatibility
  -802.11AC
    -Runs only at 5ghz band
    -runs at about 1gigabit/second
    -mostly internal antennae
    -up to 8 simultaneous MIMO streams
      -can support up to 4 clients using MIMO at the same time
-Memorize Band and Speed for each standard!

Basic WAP Setup
  -Set up SSID (Service Set Identifier Name)
    -Enable SSID Broadcast
      -turning off broadcast will make it so the network will not show up on devices, they must input it
    -set the channel
      -do a site survey (use wifi analyzer) to see what networks are overlapping
      -you can usually set it to auto
    -set the mode
      -this is to set backwards compatibility
      -usually leave it at the default
  -Apply Security
    -WPA2-PSK [AES]
      Allows you to store a Personal Storage Key. Use a long, complex password.
    -WPA-PSK + WPA2-PSK[AES]
    -WPA
    -WPA or WPA2 Enterprise
      -this turns on a RADIUS Server which requires an IP address
      -always uses port 1812

Wireless Encryption
  -used to prevent radio wave interceptions
  -WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
    -the issue here was that the way it worked, it incrementally increased the values which could be easily hacked
    -24 bits of the key are used for an initialization vector, so 64 bits only gives you 40bits
      -each key =4 bits
      -this limits you to a 10 character password if you use a 64bit key
  -WPA (Wifi Protected Access)
    -All the parts of the 802.11I standard aside from AES
    -ended up being a little more dificult to hack
    -enter a passphrase, and it will be perfectly acceptable, but ensure you use as long as password as possible
  -WPA2
    -This is a more robust version of WPA
    -the Best system availiable
    -Works similar to WPA, but it has turned on AES

Wireless Problem Scenarios
  -Interference
    -open Windows Resource Monitor
    -check the network settings for your network card, this will show the agreed upon speed
      -interference will slow down your speed
    -Use windows utilities to check speed
    -Two solutions:
      -remove interference
      -manually set your the wireless access point channel to something different
  -If connected to router, but cannot connect to internet
    -check your IP
      -if you have a 169.254 address, it's given you an apipa address
        -you have entered the wrong passcode
  -When working on a network for a while, and then can't connect
    -check connection properties
    -if you have made adjustments to your network, ensure your settings still align with the authentication protocols 
    -if the changes you madde don't match the settings on the computer, it won't connect properly
    -use forget this network and then reconnect to it
  
Connecting to a Wi-Fi Network
  -click on the wifi icon
  -choose your network connection and click connect.
  -run ipconfig to ensure valid IP address
  -WPS (wifi protected setup)
    -requires wps hardware
    -look for the password on he bottom of the router
    -most hackable thing we see
    -sounds great, doesnt work

Troubleshoot wireless connections
  -check your configuration
  -check that your antennae are pointing straight up
  -check how many clients are connected to your network
    MAC Address filter-
      -this will allow your router to only connect to approved MAC addresses

Bluetooth
  -Uses profiles
  -PAN (Personal Area Network)
    -where two devices share data between themselves
  -3 Classes of Bluetooth Devices
    -Determined by the distance the devices can be from one another and maintain a pairing
    -Class 1 - 100M
    -Class 2 - 10M
    -Class 3 - 1M
