The Internet
  -Internet Tiers
    -Tier 1
      -Peering Agreement
        -When 2 ISP Companies allow the transfer of data from the rival company so that they can both reach the full breadth of both of their networks freely
      -These are the (About 9) companies that own and run the majority of the cables around the country. 
    -Tier 2
      -Has some amount of Peering agreements, but has to pay tier 1s to use their networks
    -Tier 3
      -These companies pay either tier 1 or tier 2 companies to use their networks
      -this does not mean these are small. Comcast is a tier 3

-The Last Mile
  -The connection from an individual user to their ISP (internet service provider)
-Modem (modulator/demodulator)
-Dial-up
  -POTS
    -These are incredibly slow by today's standards
    -this used an analog signal carried via phone lines
    -Your ISP would give you a phone number and you would ahve to configure the connection inside windows
    -these connections would not be permanent, each time you opened a web client, the connection was remade
-Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
  -Was a digital solution to the dial-up issue
  -didnt have regular phones, had special phones that connected them
  -ran at 128 kb/s
  
  Broadband Connections
    -3 types of broadband you'll run into
      -DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
        -phone line connector
        -based on phone system
          -not having to pull cables since it uses your existing phone lines
          -but have to include filters
          -have to be within 18000 feet of a central office/switch from phone company
          -their upload speeds is a small fraction of the download speed
        -Point-to-Point Protocol Over Ethernet (PPPOE)
          -this is where you would input your username/password provided by your ISP
      -Cable
        -co-axial connector
        -a great way to carry data
        -limitations
          -shared network
          -guaranteed speed
      -Fiber
        -fiber optic connector
        -super fast!

Wireless Internet Connections
  -Cellular WAN
    -LTE (Long-Term Evolution)
      -these are both similar technologies
        -both use antennae
        -both have a range of 15-30 miles
        -they jump from cell tower to cell tower
       -LTE is a proprietary standard controlled by phone manufacturers
    -WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access)
      -This is beginning to fade away
  -802.11
    -Wireless access points are wireless internet connections
    -MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
      -this is a community run open wifi networks across a city
  -Satellite
    -Satellite is slower than a lot of technology, but is also wireless

Internet Applications
  -Two forms of communitcaion
    -TCP Based Connection
      -Primary protocol that is used
      -goes through the process of a handshake to ensure both computers are ready and connected.
      -more reliable option
      -Connection oriented
    -UDP Based
      -More simplistic
      -used when not as worried about the data
      -the client will send the data to the server without confirming the server is ready
      -Connectionless and faster
    Ports
      -each packet has a port in the both the to and return addresses. 
        -the to and from ports will be swapped on the return packet, so the computer will know which browser tab requested the data
      -rattle off the ports from the previous episode here
      
Telnet and SSH
  -Telnet (Port 23!)
    -command prompt tool to remotely connect to another computer's command prompt
    -comes with windows
    -go to command prompt
      -enter telnet
      -enter open followed by ip address
      -you'll have to enter a username and password
      -then be able to use the command prompt of the target computer
    -Completely Unsecure!!! 
  -SSH (Secure Shell) (Port 22!)
    -This also allows us to remotely access another computer's command prompt, but it is done securely by encrypting the data as it is transferred.
    -Windows doesnt have built in SSH, so use Putty
    -Putty
      -configure this the same way as you would a telnet connection

HTTP
  -Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
  -Http and Https
    -Http 
      -Uses Port 80
      -Unsecured connection on which data is not encrypted
      -Closes connection after data is transferred
    -Https
      -Uses Port 443
      -Secure Connection, all data transferred between server and client is encrypted
      -connection stays open while page is open
  -Netstat
    -Command Prompt tool
    -enter command netstat
      -normal to see many connections for a single tab.
        -links, ads, any other connection
    -enter netstat -n 
      -note all the 80's and 443's
    -enter netstat -n -a
      -this will show all connections (including listening ports) your computer could be connected to anything, be careful out there

E-mail
  -SMTP  (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)(Port 25!)
    -is used for you to send email
  -To get your email you use one of two options - this is determined by email server
    -Pop3 
      -runs on port 110
    -Imap
      -runs on port 143
      -allows you to create folders on the server

FTP
  -File Transfer Protocol
    -Runs officially on port 21, but also runs on port 20
    -usually you have two screens for two computers
    -for open downloads set username as anonymous
    -only downside is no encryption
  -SFTP 
    -Secure File Transfer Protocol
      -Runs on port 22
      -it can be a little tricky to set up

Remote Desktop Connections
  -telnet (Port 23)
    -this is a command prompt command, but you should use Putty
      -Select Telnet
      -Enter IP address of host IP
      -Enter user account set on host IP
      -gain access to command prompt on remote computer
    -One big issue is that everything is in the clear and unencrypted
  -SSH (Port 22)
    -Use Putty!
      -Select SSH
      -Enter IP address for server IP
      -enter the username and password
      -now you have the same access to the command prompt, but you have it encrypted
  -RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) (Port 3389)
    -Supported by most versions of windows that aren't home versions
    -Go into my computer properties
      -system > remote settings
        -Remote Assistance
          -allow remote assistance will allow you to connect as a client 
          -remote assistance allows the client to see what is happening
        -Remote Desktop
          -remote desktop will not allow the client to see what the connected host is doing to their computer
          -Allow connections
    -To get into a system allowing remote access
      -open remote desktop connection
        -search mstsc
        -enter ip address
        -enter username and password
        -and boom, you're connected
        
File/Folder Sharing
  -Go to network connections
    -properties
    -look for file and network sharing
      -turn it on!
    -client for microsoft networks
      -turn it on!
  -SMB (Server Message Block)
    -correct term
  -CIFS (Common Internet File System)
    -on A+, but it's wrong
  -TCPVIEW 
    -shows connections
    -click on local port to show by sending port
    -change to numbers and you can see ports 137, 138, and 139 for CIFS/NEETBIOS Over IP 
    -and you have port 445 for SMB.
  -Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) (Port 548)
    -only on Mac products
    -not very common
  -Linux emulates SMB with SAMBA
