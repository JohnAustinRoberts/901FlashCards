How Computers Work:
Step one: Raw Data- 
Step Two: put it into memory(RAM)
Step Three: Provide Input
Step Four: Recieve Output
Step Five: Return to Storage


Primary PC Components-
Computer Tower with all included hardware: System Unit
Monitor: Output
Keyboard: Input
Mouse: Input
Speakers: Output (2 speakers-stereo, 2 speakers w/ subwoofer: 2.1, surround sound- 5 speakers w/ subwoofer: 5.1, home theater- 7 speakers w/ subwoofer: 7.1 )
Printer: Output
Scanner: Input
If it's not the system unit, it's a peripheral. All peripherals provide input or Output

  -Sony/Phillips Digital Interface (S/PFID)
    -Usually a fiber optic cable
    -used for all things audio
  -Digital Video Interface (DvI)
    -Primary video output for systems today
    -Does not carry audio
