Hard Drive Disks-
    -The Language of Drives
        Decimal and Binary Prefixes-
        In the IT world, we use a lot of decimal prefixes. 
            -CPU we call a 3.2 ghz CPU, a 6.0Gb/s SATA 3 connector, etc.
        -for capacity with hard drive, we use gigabytes and terabytes
        -SI Units
            -Kilo (K) = 1000
            -Mega (M) = 1000 K
            -Giga (G) = 1000 M
            -Tera (T) = 1000 G
            -Peta (P) = 1000 T
            -Exa  (E) = 1000 P

        Technically these calculations are not accurate.
          -In the computer world, we use binary values.
            -If we have a 4 bit addressing system, we would have 0.0.0.0 or 1.1.1.1 or a combination of on or off. to figure the number of possible configurations we use 2 to the power of how long the address is (2^4 here)
            -In the computing world, we use much larger values than 4, so we break it into groups of 10
            -2^10, 2^20, 2^30, etc.
            -This gives us a different kind of value (IEC Binary Prefixes)
                -IEC Binary Prefixes
                -Kibi (KI) = 2^10 = 1024
                -Mebi (MI) = 2^20 = 1024 KI
                -Gibi (GI) = 2^30 = 1024 MI
                -Tebi (TI) = 2^40 = 1024 GI
                -Pebi (PI) = 2^50 = 1024 TI
                -Exbi (EI) = 2^60 = 1024 PI

        SI vs ICE 
            Kilo = 1000
            Kibi = 1024
            Mega = 1,000,000
            Mebi = 1,048,576
            Giga = 1,000,000,000
            Gibi = 1,072,741,824

        These are all almost the same numbers, there is a lot of confusion of these terms. 
        Feel comfortable using both terms, this will be on the exam.

    -Hard Drive - *Magnetic Drive* - Spindel Drive
    -where we have a rotational media (disks), then a voice coil that reads and writes data on the fly like a record player's needle
    -on the back of the Magnetic Drive you'll see electroincs, these are the IDE integrated device electronics
        -dont use that term (It's outdated)
    -these drives are now referred to as ATA Drives - ADA stands for Advanced Technology Attachment
    -the ATA standard is defines the language to talk to hard drives, connectorss, data speeds
        The proper term is ATA Drives
    -they come in 3.5inch and 2.5inch drives
    -both size drives have the same size connectors
    -Most HDDs top out ~120 MB/sec

    Hard Drive Connectors
    The first gen were Parallel ATA (PATA)
        -40 pin connectors 
        -obsolete at this point
    today we mean SATA (Serail ATA)
        -there are two types of connectors on the back of the hard drive that are both SATA cables
        -the power is the larger connector
        -the data is the smaller connector
        -SATA cables can be up to 1 meter long
        -It's an L-shaped connector, so its difficult to put on wrong without force
        -Other types of SATA 
        -eSata (External SATA)
          -external SATA made for external hard drives
          -can be up to 2 meters long
          -the connection is a pink rectangle with a notch on the bottom.
          -designed for hot plug support(plugging in and out often)
          -No power connector
          -Runs at same speeds as SATA (depending on motherboard ports)
          -max cable length is 2 meters for eSATA
        -mSata (Micro Sata)
            -looks like a small chip
            -usually used in laptops or hard drives attached to motherboards
        -SATA Versions
        -SATA 1 - 2003 1.5Gibabits/sec
        -SATA 2 - 2004 3.0Gigabits/sec
            -Native command queing
            -The ability to reorder requests for information to minimize the required number of rotations
            -First Iteration of eSATA      
        -SATA 3 - 2009 6.0Gigabits/sec
            -current version of SATA

    -Advanced Host Controller Interface
        -To ensure the system takes advantage of new features of SATA, 
        -Open BIOS
        -Look near peripherals
        -Something along the lines of SATA mode Selection)
        -You'll see ACHI or RAID or IDE (Select ACHI)
        -If working with an established system, DO NOT TURN ON ACHI

    -To ensure the system sees the new hard drive 
      -go into system setup (BIOS)
      -go to boot options and see if two hard drives are listed (it may be under something along the lines of Hard Drive BBS utility)
      -now boot up windows and then Disk Management
        -You should see two drives, your c: drive and your new drive
        -You'll still need to partition and format the drive

Solid State Drives-
   -becoming very popular
   -same SATA connectors as HDD
    -both power and data
   -Works more like RAM with chips and uses Flash Memory just like your phone or camera
   -Much faster than HDD (about 1gig/sec)
   -NVME (Non Volitile Memory Host Controler Specification)
     -a standard designed for SSDs
     -runs on PCI-E Bus
       -speed increase
     -Can run multiple queues at once 
     -to set up NVME
      -needs
       -need modern operating system
       -Need NVME motherboard
       -need NVME SSDs
      -how to
        -just buy pcie card SSD
        -SATA Express
          -Two sata ports with small extra ports
        -more common is M.2 connector
          -2 notches in a small card like connection
          -be careful when buying to verify if the connector supports SATA or NVMe
        -SATA Express and M.2 are legacy compatible systems
    -Ensure the system sees the new hard drive just like with an HDD
    -Still need to partition and format the drive

Overview-
  -Logical Block Addressing (LBA)
    -on a HDD, data is written using magnetic writing using + and - 
      -the Hard drive is stored in discreet chunks called sectors (each 4096 bytes)
    -An SSD stores the information on chips
      -The data is stored in discreet chunks called pages (each 4096 bytes)
    -LBA presents the data in discreet containers called blocks
    -think of it like a dry cleaners. 
      -each slot on the conveyor belt is a sector/pages
      -the operating system then tells the storage device which block to bring back
    -the translator is your file system.
      -this sits between the user and the LBA storage device
        -The user clicks save
        -then the file system sends the storage device a command to store the device at a specific address (LBA 43AC6952FFA7 or some such)
        -and the storage device then stores the saved data at the described location

RAID- (Random/Redundant Array of Independant Drives/Devices)
  -What is a RAID Setup?
    -As hard drives get bigger, is it better to use multiple smaller drives that can be seen as one?
      -Yes
  -Benefits are speed and data safety
  -RAID levels
    -RAID 0 - Striping
      -Must have at least 2 drives (seperated by a controller card so it's seen as one hard drive)
      -speeds up saves dramatically by saving alternating pieces of data across both hard drives
      -DANGER: If you lose either one of your hard drives, you'll lose the whole document.
    -RAID 1 - Mirroring
      -Requires at least two drives
      -As each cluster of a document is saved, it writes a copy of each cluster on each hard drive
      -Both drives end up storing the exact same 
      -May slow things down, but creates a backup of everything
      -Drive Duplexing - has 2 controllers, each controller feeding a drive in the Array
    -RAID 5 - 
      -Requires at least 3 drives
      -Take two clusters of saved data and create a parody cluster of them (which can duplicate either of the chunks if one is lost.)
      -the parody value is saved to a tertiary hard drive. 
      -If you lose one drive, the parody values will rebuild the document
      -Is faster than RAID 0
    -RAID 1+0 or RAID 10-
      -A stripe of mirrors
      -Minimum of 4 hard drives (must be an even number)
      -each set of 2 hard drives will be mirrors.
      -As we save, the first document chunk will be mirrored across the first set of mirrors,
        -then, the next chunk will get striped over to the other set of mirrors (one mirrored chunk on each drive)
        -the next piece gets mirrored on the first set,
        -the next piece mirrors on the second set.
      -If we lose an entire mirror set, all info is lost, but if we only lose 1 drive, the system will still run fine.
      -You won't see this often due to the high number of drives required

RAID Installation- 
  -How to set up a RAID Array-
    -2 ways to do it
      -Software RAID
        -Going through the Operating System (windows, linux, OS10) to set up RAID
        -Have to have blank drives to do this
          -RAID 0 - Striped  
            -Open Disk Management
            -Ensure all drives are set to Dynamic
            -Right click
            -Select New Striped Volume
            -Wizard should pop up
            -Click next
            -Currently selected disc is shown in 'Selected' column
            -Other availiable drives are in the 'Available' column
            -Select each drive you are creating the RAID array with, and click 'Add' for each one.
            -Click next
            -assign a drive letter 
            -click next
            -format the volume 
            -click next
            -click finish
        -RAID 1 - Mirrored
          -Setup
            -Open disk management
            -Ensure all drives are set to Dynamic
            -Right click
            -Select New Mirrored Volume
            -Wizard should pop
            -Currently selected disc is shown in 'Selected' column
            -Other availiable drives are in the 'Available' column
            -Select each drive you are creating the RAID array with, and click 'Add' for each one.
            -Click next
            -assign a drive letter
            -click next
            -format the volume
            -click finish
          -troubleshooting
            -If one of the mirrored drives fails
              -open disk management
              -right click on the mirrored volume
              -select break mirrored pair
                -this will cause the mirroring effect to stop. 
              -Then remove the malfunctioning drive and treat the working drive as a normal drive.
              -Next insert a new blank drive, select the existing drive, right click and create mirror
                -select the new drive and voila, after a little time (dependant on the size of the existing data to be copied), the new drive will be a mirror of the existing drive, and the mirrored RAID is back in effect.
              
      -Hardware RAID
        -Some type of controller built into our system that sets up the RAID arrays and presents them as one volume to the system
        -Typical High end mobos has hardware raid built into it. Just pick a certain number of SATA connectors and reconfigure the System for RAID
            -Most are All RAID or No RAID
            -If you try to set up RAID on a computer with Windows already on it, you'll have to reinstall Windows (there are execptions to this, but they are few and far between)
        -Firmware RAID
          -take advantage of a mobo with built in RAID functionalities to set the RAID up for us.
          -Read your motherboard book!!!! Every book is different.
          -stay organized, draw out a diagram to show how to connect your RAID array
          -Label the drives to make it easier to identify while troubleshooting. (by attaching a taped on labeled piece of paper)
          -2 Terabyes drives show up as 1.8TB in some areas of the system
          -Connect all drives to the motherboard via SATA cables
          -locate your m.2 boot drive, you'll build the arrays outside of your boot drive
          -open system setup
          -open SATA mode selection, select RAID
          -reboot system
          -re-enter system setup, find where to create RAID Volume 
          -Set your RAID level
          -select the drives you want
          -click create volume
          -Now bootup windows
            -go to disk manager
            -you'll see them as one large drive that needs to be formatted
        -Hardware RAID
          -Dedicated RAID Controller
            -Plug regular SATA drives into the controller and those will be your RAID array
            -This is the best option.
            -Look for a system setup just for the RAID array. It's not in System Setup, but will be a similar prompt on boot
              -Select the drives, click save.
              -watch it automagically work!
              -Windows Disk management will see it as one drive.
              -Pulling a drive out and adding a new one in it's place is called being Hot Swappable, this is possible on large systems with 7 or 8 hard drives. 
                -You can also keep a spare drive called a Hot Drive to do you Hot Swap with
              -You can set up an extra drive to have the controller fail over to if one of your active hard drives fails.


Setting the Boot Order-
  -After turning on a system unit, your system runs it's POST, tries to find an OS to boot to
  -to make this work, somewhere in BIOS we have set a boot order to tell the system where to boot from
  -In general, you boot off where your windows hard drive is located
    -exceptions
      -if installing windows may need to boot from DVD drive
      -or maybe boot off a utility off a thumb drive 
  -to set boot order, go to system setup
    -go to the boot tab
    -look to the right for instructions on how to move selected items up or down the boot order
    -if booting from thumb drive, ensure the drive is inserted before booting up the system
      -it then should show up in system settings
    -UEFI
      -provides robust boot methodology
      -got into UEFI BIOS utility  
        -Go to Boot options
        -Look at Boot Option Priorities
          -Click and choose your boot order
          -All that really matters is what boots first
  -If someone is having an issue where every time that they boot up, the wrong OS loads, their boot order is out of whack

Hard Drive Troubleshooting-
  -In today's society the most expensive part of IT troubleshooting is you
  -If a hard drive is failing, it is cheaper to back it up, and replace it instead of trying to repair the drive
  -Issues on the A+
    -Slow performance
      -Defragmentation
        -Under Administrative tools (usually)
        -Happens as an automatic task every few days as a background program in windows
        -Defragmentation takes files that have become spread out across the drive, and pulls them together for faster speeds 
        -How to
          -Select drive to Defragmentation
          -Analyze the Drive
          -Optimize the Drive
      -Disk cleanup
        -Disk cleanup deletes unnecessary files
        -This will come up automatically when your drive is extremely full
      -If neither of these work, back up your data and replace the drive.
    -Read/Write errors
      -Very fucking scary things
      -If this happens once, not an issue. If it happens weekly, this is when it gets scary.
      -only happens on hard disk drives
      -3 options
        -Use error checking launched from graphic Interface
            -goes through drive, checking each block individually, marking bad blocks
            -open file explorer
            -right click on the drive in question
            -go to properties
            -tools tab
            -click on error checking
            -this can take a while (up to hours)
        -CHKDSK launched from command lines
          -open command prompt
          -enter CHKDSK and hit enter
          -it will scan and return information about the status
          -if you want it to fix the disk, add the /F flag 
            -CHKDSK /F
        -Back up your data and buy a new drive.
    -Loud Clicking Noises
      -Even scarier than Read Write errors
        -spooling up and random clicking
          -drive is dying. replace immediately
        -spooling while continous clicking, then spool down and clicking becomes scratches
          -back up your drive and get new hard drive
    -Drive not recognized
      -Was it installed correctly?
        -check connections
         -both data and power
         -and power to the power source
        -check BIOS
          -it should show up here
        -if it doesnt, check controller settings
          -it could be turned off
          -are you using AHCI when you hould be using SATA?
        -If BIOS sees it and Windows doesn't
          -check the manufacturer for drivers
        -If still not found
          -go buy a new drive. womp womp
    -Operating System Not found
      -Remove any unbootable media (thumbdrives, etc.)
      -Check Boot Order
        -Occasionally the BIOS will change Boot order
      -You may have corruption
        -rebuild operating system
          -Use windows repair utility
            -this will repair the corruption issue
      -If that doesnt work
        -Replace the drive
      -Crash Screen
        -BSoD
        -Pinwheel of death
        -Linux crash Screen
        -most panic inducing thing to see as a Tech
        -Hard drives are usually the least of your concerns in this time
        -Read the text to get insight into what the cause is
        -Utilize Error Checking or Windows Repair tools
        -If none of that works, buy a new drive
      -S.M.A.R.T. (System Monitoring And Reporting Technology)
        -Used to create values that are imposed on the hard drive to allow the hard drive to proc errors when an issue arises
        -Used to give a heads up that hard drive will die soon.
        -Windows has no native S.M.A.R.T.
        -Some BIOS have built in S.M.A.R.T.
          -during boot system will query the drives and if anything is bad, it'll show an error message
        -If you want to use S.M.A.R.T. in a windows environment, you'll need to utilize third party Software
          -Pass Mark utility
            -Click on a drive
            -A number of crazy values will be displayed. 
              -These are preset values by the manufacturer to what we expect the error to be
            -Every system will have different s.m.a.r.t. values
            -Mostly it's just querying the drive
        -OS X and beyond have built in  S.M.A.R.T. support
        -S.M.A.R.T is a predictor that a drive is going to die
          -As S.M.A.R.T. errors climb, backup and replace your drive
      -But I need the drive fixed!
        -If information must be recovered from a failing drive
          -First, laugh at the person for not having a backup. 
            -go on, I'll wait...
            -
            -
            -ok, let's continue
          -Next, look for a company to recover the data. this is beyond our scope
          -this is very expensive (minimum of 500$)
