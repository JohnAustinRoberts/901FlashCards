RAM-
 A Stick of RAM

 Types of RAM-
  DRAM (Dynamic RAM)
   -has been improved dramatically over 30 years
  4 types that have been used
    -SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM) 
      -Synchronized to system clock
      -168 Pin DIMM (Dual inline Memory Modules)
      -has 2 notches is bottom
      -Clock Speed meant RAM started getting Speed Ratings
    -Dual Data Rate SDRAM- DDR-SDRAM
      -184 Pin DIMM
      -Single notch
      -Takes motherboard speed, and doubles it. thus speeding up ram without speeding up motherboard
      -Take the mobo speed (100Mhz), double it, and that gives you stick speed (200 Mhz) then x8 = PC1600
    -DDR2 
      -240 Pin DIMM
      -single notch, in a different spot than DDR-SDRAM
      -Take mobo speed (100mhz), double it, (200MHz), double it again (400Mhz) then x8 = PC2 3200 
    -DDR3 
      -240 Pin DIMM
      -Single notch, again in a new spot.
      -Take mobo speed (100mhz), quadruple it, (400Mhz), double it (800Mhz) then x8 = PC3 6400

Ram Capacity
-When installing RAM, install them at the same capacity (i.e. 3 4gb sticks, not 2 4gb and one 2 gb.)
-Reference your mobo handbook, it'll tell you the biggest RAM your mobo can handle

Other Types of RAM
-Weird RAM
  -RAMBUS RAM
    -pretty much faded out
    -first Double pump RAM
    -184 Pin RIMM
    -had to install it in 2s. 
    -If you had any additional open slots, you had to insert a CRIMM (Continuity RIMM) which is basically a placeholder
  -Single Sided RAM- Only has memory chips on one side of the stick
  -Double Sided RAM- Very popular, but have to have a mobo that supports it.
  -ECC (Parity Memory) RAM - designed with extra chips for error correction. Can only be used on mobos that accept ECC RAM
    -Mostly for Servers
  -SODIMM (Small Outline DIMM) - Laptop RAM
    -Same speeds as regular desktop RAM
    -usually lower capacity due to physical size
    -the trick here, is to make sure you have the right size for the laptop. Typical sizes 100, 144, 200 pin varieties.
    -SODIMM 204 Pin are Unique to DDR3
  -Always buy brand-name RAM

Installing RAM-
-Check your Mobo book to see what RAM is compatible
-Dual Triple or Quad Channel-
 Requires 2, 3, or 4 sticks
-every stick in the channel needs to be the same speed and capacity
-open the clips, insert the RAM stick so that the notch lines up, 
-push down in the center, until it clicks into place.

Possible issues - 
  Computer doesn't boot/Can't see RAM you just added. 
    -May have the sequencing off.
    -May have different sized RAM sticks

Troubleshooting RAM-
 a) installation errors
   How to find out what windows thinks you have installed.
    Windows>Start>>Computer>Right-Click>Properties
        Under Installed RAM you'll see what Windows is seeing.
        If it's not showing correctly, it's probably installed improperly
    CPU-Z
      SPD (Serial Presence Detect) Tab
      Will show exactly what type, speed, bandwidth, manufacturer of RAM
      This will also show what slots the RAM is in.
 b) when things go poof!
    When RAM Dies...
    MTBF-Mean Time Between Failures is usually measured in decades.
    Symptoms:
      Random Reboots,
      Complete Freezes,
      Melting Screen, 
      Blue screen of Death.
    So what to do? 
    If you dont have windows 7 or better, look at memtest86 have to boot into it, not a windows program
        memtest86 is a slooooow process (hours to run)
        It will return hexadecimal notation if one of your sticks is bad. 
    If we do have windows 7 or later, 
      go to control panel > admin tools > windows memory diagnostic > restart now and check for problems
      aaaaaaaaand wait. 
    the trick to dealing with bad ram, no one is going to point to a particular stick. It's mostly process of elimination.
