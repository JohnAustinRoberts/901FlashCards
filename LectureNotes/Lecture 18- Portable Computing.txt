Proper Laptop Disassembly
  -look for manufacturer repair manual
  -like surgery, you're going in for a reason
  -remove cover
  -If removing tape, if at all possible, keep it intact so it can be replaced when repairs are done
  -Make a sketch of where each piece came from as you remove each piece
    -or take a picture before you remove each piece
  -hold and organize your screws with tape in labeled envelopes

Power Management
   -Standards
    -APM (Advanced Power management) Standard
      -came out in mid-90s
    -ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Standard
      -replaced APM
  -turning on power management
    -used to be done in BIOS
      -these settings are mostly ignored by the OS
      -except for Wake on LAN
    -ACPI is usually on at all times on modern computers
      -doesn't mean it's in use, but it's ready 
      -state 1 - ready
      -state 2 - close unnecessary programs
      -state 3 - sleep/standby mode
        -Keeps RAM powered, and shuts off all other systems
      -state 4 - hibernate
        -copies RAM to disk and shuts down
        -becoming unpopular, being replaced by hybrid states where hibernate would be used
      -Hybrid Mode
        -a mix of sleep and hibernate
        -keeps RAM powered, but copies RAM to disk
        -this allows for quick reboot, but without the risk of losing data if the power runs out for RAM
        -In windows on desktop hybrid mode is on by default, but not on laptops
          -the reason is that laptops are usually closed and put in a bag. this would not be an ideal time to write the RAM contents to the drive
    -In Windows, we can use Power Plans (or a similarly named thing)
      -you can choose either balanced, high performance, or if you click additional options, you'll see power saver
      -you can click on adjust plan settings, and then advanced options to find the option to enable hybrid mode
      -you can also create your own custom power plan
        -enter a plan name
        -configure your settings

Troubleshooting Laptops
  -sticky keys
    -use canned air to clean them
    -if the spring is broken, you'll have to replace the keyboard
      -it's not too hard, just be very gentle and follow the manufacturer instructions
  -Replaceing monitor
    -you'll have to replace the fragile ribbon cable
    -these make sure it's well connected
