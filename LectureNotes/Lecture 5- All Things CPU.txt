What is a CPU?
Central Processing Unit
The brain of the computer
It's all based on micro-architecture
One set of micro-architecture can be used to make multiple CPUs
Intel and AMD are the two big CPU manufacturers
CPU-Z 
  -Free program to tell you all about your CPU

Microprocessors-
 CPUs come with a rated speed
 hertz - times per second
 System Crystal - little piece of quartz ocillating at a determined speed
 The CPU have a multiplier, that runs faster than the system crystal on the motherboard
 this is called a clock multiplier (hence over-clocking...)
 overclocking can allow you to push the CPU past its rated speed

 Multicore CPUs
 multiple 'mini'-cpus (cores) inside a single physical chip
 hyperthreading (intel i7) will virtually duplicate each of these mini-cpus
 
CPU Caches-
 Cache takes a litle of what we need and makes it more accessible

Process
 -hard drive > Ram > CPU

Caches-
-Temporary storage to speed up/help processing by having ready to utilize data
-Programs live on your Hard drive
-when you double click on a program, some of the program is copied to RAM, and the CPU is told where to start running the program
-there is also a little RAM inside the CPU(Static RAM), this is the Cache
-the more cache you have, the harder it is to find relevant data in the cache
-the closest one to the cpu is level 1, these are always the smallest, fastest cache
-the larger cache is called level 2, and runs at about half the speed of a level 1 cache
-in most systems today, we also have a level 3 cache, which is even larger, and is running usually at around motherboard speed.
-caching is completely automatic, it depends on the microarchitecture of the CPU



32 vs 64 bit processing
-Address Bus-
 -Usually 64 or 32 bit
 -32 wires or 64 wires connecting CPU to RAM 
 -a 32 bit cpu can only address up to 4gb of RAM
 -in a 64 bit cpu, can address much much more RAM
 -Most CPUs today can run either 32 or 64. If at all possible, run in 64 bit mode
   -start > computer > right-click > properties > System type



CPU Extensions- 
 -Today, 2 big ones-
   -Virtualization Support
    -creating Virtual Computer inside your own Computer
    -takes a lot of work on the CPU, Usually done in BIOS
    
  -Integrated GPU-
   -Integrates a video card into the CPU, to make for smaller systems, and save on power
   
CPU Packages and Sockets-
-The whole idea of CPU sockets allows for the CPU to be easily upgraded to a better version of the CPU without replacing the motherboard
-There are several different kinds of sockets, lets go over them.
 -Num of Pins, Physical Size, Thermal Characteristics, etc, 
 -All we need to know-
  -LGA Sockets
    -Land Grid Array
    -All Intel CPUs are LGA CPUs
    -still called ZIF, even though has large cover tray
    -The pins are actually on the socket with pads (lands) on the chip, some people like these better as they are harder to break installing
  -PGA Sockets
    -Pin Grid Array
    -All AMD CPUs are PGA CPUs
    -ZIF (Zero Inserfion Force) Sockets - like the one in my pc with the little lift bar
        Intel- (LGAs)
            -Intel LGA 775
            -Made by Intel, with 775 Lands on the CPU
            -First Mainstream LGA CPU
            -Ran with DDR2
            -Started with Pentium 4

            -Intel LGA 1156
            -Made by Intel, with 1156 Lands on the CPU
            -First Socket to support Built-in North Bridge
            -DDR3 support

            -Intel LGA 1366
            -Made by Intel, with 1366 Lands on the CPU
            -for more powerful computers
            -built in memory controller
            -still had north bridge for PCIE Bus support
            -Pretty much used only on Core i7

            -Intel LGA 1155
            -Replaced LGA 1156
            -Pcs using these were the first with full support on-board graphics
            -Core i3, i5, i7

            -Intel LGA 2011
            -Replaced LGA 1366
            -Started with DDR 3, then DDR4
            -First system to stop supporting PCI, only PCI Express
            -Only used on i7 processor

            -Intel LGA 1150
            -this is mainstream socket
            -supports multiple CPUs
            -started with DDR3, and now also does DDR4, and supports an outrageous number of PCIE devices

        AMD- (PGAs)
            -AM Type Sockets - Mainstream type sockets 
              -Socket AM2
                -940 Pins
                -Hyper-transport capability
                -Supported DDR2
              -Socket AM3

                -Substantially more PCIE support



How to install the CPU-
  Ensure your CPU matches the socket and speed of your motherboard
  Wear your ESD
  Note the notch that all CPUs have, and line it up with the CPU socket, should drop in with no force
  Lower lever.
  Add Thermal Compound to bas of CPU fan, if it's not already there
  Set fan on top of CPU, lock it into place. 
  Should be able to pick up motherboard by cooling fan
  Plug the CPU Fan into Motherboard.

Cooling Your PC-
  -Fans
    -CPU fans
    -Graphic Card fans
    -Case fans
    -The trick to cooling is to keep your system cool enough to run well, while balancing sound production from fans
    -Anytime the connector has 4 cables, you can control the speed of the fan
    -OEM Fan - (Original Equipment Manufacturer)
        -Most of the time when you buy a CPU it comes with a fan
    -Third Party Fan
        -More cooling than OEM fans, typically larger.
        -Usually your OEM Fan is good enough.
    -How to control the fans-
        -In Motherboard Settings
        -With third-party utilites
        -SpeedFan (works on most motherboards)
  -Liquid Cooling 
    -been around over 15 years
    -Passive Liquid Cooling-
      -The liquid goes through a mount on the CPU, takes the heat, runs through a radiator which cools it down, and then runs it through again
      -helps for quieter system, with better cooling than a fan system
      -remember, it works with the same connectivity wise as a fan. 
    -Active Liquid Cooling-
      -Like a fridge, pumps refridgerant into your PC
