How Monitors Work-
  -Liquid Crystal Display(LCD)
    -If you give electricity to an LCD, you can see through it. If no electricity is given, it remains opaque
  -Pixels are made from LCDs
  -A single Pixel is composed of 3 pieces called elements
    -These elements are each a different color and are arranged in a stripe formation
    -When a color is determined, that element becomes electrified, allowing the light behind it to shine through, and create the appropriate color on the monitor
    -The backlight is regular fluorescent light called a C CFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp)
      -CCFLs are powered by AC power.
      -Monitors use AC adapters, and converts all of the incoming power to DC
      -This causes an issue and results in the need for an Inverter
        -Known as one of the problem children of LCD panels
        -converts DC power to AC
        -One of the problems we run into is if the screen goes black, the inverter may need to be replaced
        -Very easy to replace inverter, costs about 30$. Just a lot of screws.
  -Millions of pixels are needed to create a screen
    -think about a mosaic
  -Native Resolution
    -this is the value that is given by the manufacturer when a monitor is built
    
  -Plasma and DLP Displays
    -LED (Light Emitting Diode)
      -Still uses same LCD pixels but use LED lights instead of CCFLs
      -Have a longer life than CCFLs
      -Have a brighter image, though not as warm
    -Plasma
      -Each pixel has a fluorescent light for each of the three elements of the pixel 
      -The amount of electricity passed to each light adjust the color
      -When certain gases are electricly charged they ionize and glow
      -Have some big advantages over LCD
        -Have blacker black
      -Some issues
        -Screen burn-in
        -Screen Door effect - if you get too close, you can see the wires between pixels
        -Use much more power than LCD
    -Digital Light Processing (DLP)
      -Made of a bank of microsopic mirrors
      -Each mirror can be controlled individually by a mesh of wires and can tilt back and forth
      -to create an image, the image is shined onto the bank and the mirrors tilt on and off
      -for color, there is a color wheel spinning in front of the light shining the image, and the mirrors tilt when the cappropriate color is up on the wheel
      -this all happens insanely fast. 
      -also comes in a beefier form with 3 banks of mirrors
        -instead of color wheel it utilizes a prism to seperate the image into it's red green and blue components
        -each bank then controls the red, green, and blue
      -Really a projector when you think about it.
      -Used in rear projection tv or actual projectors
      -only down side is you need very bright bulbs, which can get expensive.

VGA and DVI
  -Video Graphics Adapter/Array (VGA)
    -Was predominant video output for decades
    -it was an analog adapter, and had to be connected to a RAM DAC (a RAM DAC would change the digital signal from the video card into an analog signal the CRT monitor could understand)
    -It would then output on 15 pins in three rows to a CRT monitor
    -As we began to see LCDs, the industry realized they needed a digital connection
  -Digital Video Interface (DVI)
    -Because this is digital instead of analog, it did not reqire a RAM DAC, and RAM could be mounted directly on the video card
    -Has been around about 20 years
    -The issue is, DVI came out before LCDs were common and so they had to also connect to analog CRT monitors
    -a few things you could do
      -some video cards came with both vga and dvi and you could plug into either one
      -use a DVI-to-VGA adapter
         -avoid using these if possible
    -DVI was designed to be backward compatible and there are a few different types
      -DVI-I (DVI Digtal and Analog) Single Link
        -Extremely common
      -DVI-D (DVI Digital) Single Link
        -has a single dash on the left side of the port
        -It's missing the 4 holes around the dash, which carry the analog signal
      -DVI-A (DVI Analog) 
    -Has issues with resolutions beyond 1920x1080 (Standard High Definition) so they came up with Dual Link DVI
      -Dual Link DVI
        -DVI-I(DVI Digital and Analog) Dual Link
          -has full array of pins
        -DVI-D (DVI Digital) Dual Link
          -has full array of pins except those around the keying slot (a.k.a. the dash)
        
Other Video Connectors
  -Composite Video
    -yellow cable
    -Usually comes with Red and White stereo connectivity
    -Oldest and worst connection
    -designed to carry old school NTSC (original tv type signals)
  -S-Video Connector
    -6-pin DIN connector
    -slightly better than Composite
    -Was designed for European televisions, and instead of carrying NTSC (American), it carried the European version PAL
  -Component (RGB connectors)
    -Same as composite except the yellow cable for video is replaced by a red cable, a green cable, and a blue cable, increasing the quality of the video throughput
    -still not able to carry high definition video
  -SPDIF (Sony/Phillips Digital Interface)
    -a powerful connection
    -it's audio only
  -DisplayPort
    -Not as popular as HDMI
    -Supports audio video and data
  -HDMI
    -Most common connector on modern systems
    -Two types of connectors
      -Standard HDMI
      -Mini HDMI
    -Both connectors work exactly the same, one is just smaller
  -Video over ethernet
    -can carry video information very far distances

Graphics Cards
  -Features to watch out for
    -don't buy a card your monitor can't handle
      -check your connections!
    -ensure that power is connected
      -and enough power
    -make sure the card has room to breathe for the fan
      -one open PCI-E slot worth of room is ok, more room is better
    -some cards are double-wide, be careful where you install to not block off any unneeded space
    -You'll need drivers 
      -the drivers are updated regularly. 
      -Reference Drivers
        -not designed for particular video cards
        -they are designed for particular GPUs
        -Not ideal, but will do the job if needed
      -Extra utilites also can come with updates to drivers
        -these can let you do more advanced configurations

Projectors
  -One big issue is Resolution
  -also look out for lumens (the brightness the projector can put out)
    -used to be measured in the hundreds
    -today it is measured in the thousands
    -1100 lumens is acceptable, higher is better but more expensive
  -also have to look out for Throw
    -the closer the porjector is to the screen, the smaller the image
    -the further back, the larger the image
  -Some software will see a projector attached and will prompt to display out through the projector.
  -Light Bulbs 
    -most expensive part of the projector
    -usually a halide/mercury vapor bulb
    -be super careful working with these!

Troubleshooting
  -VGA Mode (Also called Low Resolution Mode)
    -When a monitor is in a square box with low resolution on a nice monitor
    -A video driver issue causes Windows to go into this mode
    -Main causes-  
      -You set it up wrong
      -Your video driver is having serious issues.
         -go to device manager, remove the driver and re-install the driver
  -No image on screen
    -Don't panic
    -Is the monitor turned on and plugged in
    -check connections
    -is computer asleep?
      -shake mouse
    -did you turn the brightness all the way down
    -a secondary video connection button could turn off primary display
    -some video cards push video mode your monitor can't handle
      -boot into low resolution mode
      -turn the resolution down
    -sometimes monitors die
      -time to replace it
    Overheat
      -if the screen goes blank and then comes back
        -and then it does it again
          -and again
            -and again
              -check your system for dirt
              -make sure it has room to breathe
              -replace fans
              -clear dust
              -install liquid cooling
    -Dead Pixels
      -A pixel that not working at all.
        -it is not recieving any signal(black)
      -a Stuck pixel is one that is stuck at one color
        -replace the monitor
    -Video Artifacts
      -weird things that appear other than the normal screen
      -check your connections
        -unplug and replug
      -check your video card driver 
        -upgrade or replace your driver
      -overheating video card
      -Video RAM going wrong
      -Nothing is wrong at all, it just happens with compression
    -Color Patterns incorrect
      -Two types of situation
        -monitor is not set up correctly
          -check your monitor settings (on screen display)
        -check your connections
          -particularly VGA and DVI
    -Dim Image and Flickering Image
      -Dim Image
        -Check the brightness on your monitor
        -Check if you need to replace the CCFL, the LEDs, or the Inverter
          -replace the device
      -Flickering Image
        -not really an issue on today's monitors
        -check your connections
      -Distored image and Distorted Geometry
        -Distored Image
          -Check Connections
          -Overscan
            -with certain TV connections, the screen displayed is bigger than the physical screen
            -go into display settings and turn on overscan
        Distorted Geometry
          -Seen in projectors
          -Pin cushioning
            -where the sides of the image are going in and out
          -Keystoning
            -weird trapezoidal shape
          -Screen is cut off on one of the side
          -Within the projector's settings, you can adjust for this
      -Screen Burn-in
        -Something that is permenantly burned into the screen
        -This is not as often of an issue, but still can happen.
        -Replace the monitors
        -In today's world, transient image persistance (image sticking)
          -similar to burn in, but repairable
          -run built in static on monitors
      -Oversized images and text
        -check if you are in VGA/Low Resolution mode
        -Check your drivers
        -Check windows Icon size settings
        -Check windos DPI (dots per inch) settings
