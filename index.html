When the fluorescent gases become electrified, they ionize and change color, giving us pictures."}, {"front": "What are advantages and disadvantages of using plasma monitors?", "back": "Plasma is able to have some of the blackest blacks due to there being an actual absence of light on a black pixel instead of an opaque front covering. Some issues though, are that in the early days of plasma, you had to be very careful about screen burn-in, and still today you can see the wire mesh that powers the individual pixels if you get too close to the screen. The other issue is that is uses much more power than a LCD screen."}, {"front": "What does DLp stand for? And where is it used/found?", "back": "Digital Light Processing is used primarily in projectors. This process shines the image on a bank of microscopic mirrors, which are controlled individually by a wire mesh to make the individual mirrors tilt and siplay the image. There is a color wheel that is spinning, and the mirrors flick on and off at incredible speed to project the desired color."}, {"front": "How many pins are ona VGA cable connector?", "back": "15 Pins."}, {"front": "Is VGA an analog or digital connection?", "back": "Analog, and had to be connected to a RAM DAC."}, {"front": "What are the different types of DVI connectors?", "back": "There are a few DVI connectors. DVI-I (carries digital and analog signals. This is the most common DVI). DVI-D (carries only digital signal, thus it is missing the 4 analog ports around the key dash). DVI-A (carries only analog signal). There are also Dual Link DVI cables that can support resolutions higher than 1920x1080. These are the DVI-I Dual Link (carries both analog and digital signals) and the DVI-D Dual Link (which carries only a digital signal)."}, {"front": "Describe the Composite connectors.", "back": "Composite connectors come with three cable connections that are all color coded. The yellow cable carries video, while the white and red cables carry audio. This is a very outdated system and should be avoided if possible."}, {"front": "Describe an S-Video Connector.", "back": "An S-Video connector is a 6-pin DIN port. It is only slightly better than composite, and was designed for European televisions."}, {"front": "Define and describe SPDIF.", "back": "The sony Phillips Digital Interface is a powerful audio connection, but cannot carry video signals."}, {"front": "What is DisplayPort?", "back": "DisplayPort is a connector that is not as popular as HDMI, but is capable of carrying high def audio and video."}, {"front": "Describe and Dfine HDMI.", "back": "The High Definition Multimedia Interface is the most common type of connector today. There are two sizes of HDMi, Standard and Mini. Both of these connectors work exactly the same, one is just smaller than the other."}, {"front": "What connector can carry video of very far distances?", "back": "Video over Ethernet can be run for miles."}, {"front": "What is an acceptable measure of Lumens for a projector?", "back": "Anything over 1100 lumens is acceptable."}, {"front": "What is a Projector's Throw?", "back": "The throw is what determines the size of the displayed image at different distances. For example, one projector may throw a 5footx8foot image from 10 feet away, where another projector may throw the same size image from 5 feet away. This is important to consider when purchasing a projector that will be set in a fixed location."}, {"front": "What do you do if your monitor is suddenly in a 4:3 aspect ration and you have big bars on each side of the displayed image?", "back": "You are in VGA/Low Resolution Mode. This is usually caused by a driver issue. Update your display drivers to rectify the issue."}, {"front": "What to do if there is no image displayed on the screen?", "back": "Check all of your connections between the monitor and the system unit. Check that power is plugged in and connected. Shake the mouse to ensure the computer is not asleep. Ensure the brightness is not lowered all the way. Check for a secondary video button that may disable your primary display. Try to boot into low resolution mode and reset your resolution. If none of that works, replace the monitor."}, {"front": "What to do if the monitor keeps going blank, and then comes back again, and then goes blank a few minutes later, only to come back.", "back": "This indicates that the monitor is overheating. Check your system for dirt, ensure the Card has room to breathe, clear any excess dust in the machine, and consider installing liquid cooling system."}, {"front": "What to do if you have a Dead Pixel? A stuck pixel? What's the difference?", "back": "A dead pixel recieves no input so it stays as a black dot on your screen. A Stuck pixel is stuck on a certain color, usually either red, blue, or green. There is no fix for a dead or stuck pixel, deal with it until you can't and then replace the monitor."}, {"front": "What are Video Artifacts? How do you deal with them?", "back": "Video artifacts are strange bars and lines that will appear over your display. Ways to fix this is to check all of your connections, update or replace your video card drivers. This could also indicate an overheating video card, or that the Video RAM is going bad. Though, sometimes it is not an issue, it jsut happens with video compression."}, {"front": "If the color patterns are backwards on a monitor, what do you do?", "back": "Check your connections first and foremost. Then check your monitor's settings if it has a built in menu-system."}, {"front": "What if my monitor has a dim image or a flickering image?", "back": "This indicates that the light is going out in your monitor, and it's time to replace either the CCFL, the LEDs, or the Inverter. It's usually easier to just replace the whole monitor."}, {"front": "If your monitor is displaying a distorted image or distorted geometry, what do you do?", "back": "Distorted imagery can happen because of bad connections or due to overscan. Check your connections and use the overscan option in display settings to rectify these issues. Distorted geometry is an issue you may see in projectors. Two common types of distorted geometry are Pin cushioning, where the edge of the image goes in and out, and Keystoning, which produces a weird trapezoidal shape. Withing the projector's on device menu, you can usually adjust to fix any of these issues."}, {"front": "All of my images and text are showing up oversized! How do I fix this?", "back": "Check to see if you are in VGA/Low Resolution Mode. Check your display drivers, check you windows icon size settings, and check the windows DPI (dots per inch) settings."}];
